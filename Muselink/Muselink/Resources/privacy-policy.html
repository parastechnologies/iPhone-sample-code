      <p>By using the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy or any future Privacy Policy we post at <a href="" class="link">Muselink.app/privacy</a>. If you do not agree to these terms, please delete your Account immediately.</p>
      <p>By submitting Personal Information (as defined below) through the Muselink App / Platform, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h4>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US</h4>
      <p>To maximize your user experience, we may ask you to provide information about yourself including information that could be used to personally identify or contact you (such as your name, telephone number, email address, or home address) ("Personal Information").  We may collect Personal Information at various times over the course of your use of the Platform, including but not limited to, when you create an Account, post on the Platform or other social media sites, redeem rewards, access content, participate in a survey, promotion or other feature of the Platform, request information, submit comments, or otherwise use the Platform. "Non-Personal Information" means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Non-Personal Information does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons and, therefore, this policy does not limit or restrict in any way our ability to use or disclose Non-Personal Information. If you do not consent to our unrestricted use of Non-Personal Information, please delete your Account immediately.</p>
      <p>When you make a purchase via in app purchase or a third-party form of payment such as a credit card, debit card, PayPal account or other approved payment, you will need to submit your financial and other billing information for secure processing directly to a third-party payment service who will be clearly identified to you prior to the transaction.

Muselink may store your access credentials and/or an access token or similar Oauth credentials obtained from the third-party service for any such account (collectively, "Connected Accounts"), so that you are able to access those third party services without entering your access credentials again.

      <h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY</h4>
      <p>Whenever you interact with the Platform either on a Muselink owned website or through an integration on a Brand or Affiliate owned website, we and our partner Brands and Affiliates, third-party service providers and advertisers may use various technologies (such as analytics software, device identifiers or a small data file or persistent "cookie" which is transferred to your device or browser for access on future visits to the Platform) that automatically collects information about how you access and use the Platform ("Usage Information").
